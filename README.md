## Project Overview
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
## Results
Describe how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

When the website is loaded, the table will contain the entirety of the data. On the left side of the website is the section to filter the search. The data can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

Once a filter term is entered, the table will only show the appropriate data.

Multiple search parameters can be added, and the resulting table will show only data that is filtered by all parameters.
